            <p><em>answer:</em>The most alarming thing was a case where the code base only existed as long as the job interview was going on — in the applicant‘s head. Or should I say on his tongue? My boss told me he had found the perfect person to lead
                our new Customer Support department. In the interview, he told me, the guy had presented him with a knowledge base tool where Support could store all solutions they ever communicate to the customer, and where the technical team could document
                all known problems and solutions. I was impressed. <button onclick="myFunction()"><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i></button> <button onclick="myFunction()"><i class="fa fa-times"></i></button> </p>
